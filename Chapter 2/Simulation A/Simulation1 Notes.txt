Notes on Plot3

Parameters are set A_Lin = 20 and G_Lin = 400;

(too high! - think about the t constant)
The Plot is the result of channel 1 active from 1 sec to 10 sec
and channel 2 from 15 sec to 25 sec.

Plot 4:

Just to show what would happen if two channel are inactivated at the same time
CH1 fires from 1 to 29.
CH2 fires from 10 to 20

Plot 5:

CH1 fires from 10 to 20
CH2 fires from 1 to 29

Plot 6


CH1 fires from 5 to 15
CH1 fires from 20 to 30

Here, D2 is deactivated. As you can see, there is not much difference at all!
For D1 only or D1 and D2, All output channels are at maximum level (1), that is INHIBIT the thalamus


For the Surface Dopa-Time:

w_e = 1; w_inh = 0.03; w_minus = 1.02; w_plus = 1;
w_t = w_s = 1;

system seems to be very unstable. Slight variation
in the value produce great changes.

Channel1: from 5 to 15.
Channel2: from 10 to 20
